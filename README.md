# ML_ANN
optimized ML-ANN algorithm

Feature Extraction method: Histogram of Oriented Gradients. -> HOG.py
Clustering Algorithm: K-means -> K-means.py
distance measure: Chi-square -> ChiSquare.py

for running the algorithm you should run the Optimized_MLANN.py but keep in mind that if you are using a dataset rather than 
"Csessex.ac.uk, Face Recognition Data. [online] Available at: https://cswww.essex.ac.uk/mv/allfaces/faces94.html," you have to call the reading_files, distance_comp, and clustering functions.
